This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is my attempt at recreating the process laid out in this tutorial by [beyond fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__mSgDEOyv8&t=1s). Credit to them for the original code & excellent video.
